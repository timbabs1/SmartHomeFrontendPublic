# SmartHomeFrontendPublic
A React Front end app is used to display information from the backend (nodejs koa) and shows data from the different sensors to the users
The users can then change parameters such as temperature if they perhaps for example want a room to be hotter or cooler
Hosted online so the user can access this information from anytime and anywhere as far as they have an internet connected device
